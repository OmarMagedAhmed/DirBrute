# DirBrute üìÅ

A simple Python-based directory bruteforcing tool. It attempts to discover hidden directories and files on a web server by iterating through a user-provided wordlist and checking for valid responses.

### Responsible use
- This tool is intended for **authorized** security testing only (your own systems or systems for which you have explicit permission).
- Misuse of scanning/brute-force tools is illegal and unethical.
- Use responsibly.

### Features ‚ú®
* **Wordlist-Based:** Reads from any provided wordlist file.
* **Simple & Fast:** Sends `GET` requests to discover content.
* **Error Handling:** Ignores connection errors for non-existent targets.
* **Status Codes:** Reports the status code of found resources.

### Prerequisites üìã
To run this tool, you'll need Python 3 and the `requests` library.

You can install the required library using pip:
```bash
pip install requests
```
*(Alternatively, you can use the `requirements.txt` file by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`)*

You will also need a **wordlist** file. A small example, `directories.txt`, is included. For more effective testing, you can use larger, more comprehensive wordlists from projects like [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).

### How to Run üïπÔ∏è
1.  **Clone or download** this repository.
2.  **Install prerequisites** as shown above.
3.  **Navigate** to the directory:
